If you've ever heard of the hit game 'Pac-Man' and wanted to play it, but it was too high quality and fun to play, then this game is for you! Made entirely in PyGame it features a unique difficulty level where each level sees you move faster and faster until you're practically flying across the screen, testing your reaction speeds. The pathfinding of the ghosts is relentless as well, they will hunt you down no matter what and won't stop until all your lives are gone. Even I can't beat all the levels, so if you can, please tell me I'll be very very impressed.

I made this mostly as a joke but I spent way longer than I expected on it, as I kept adding features to it, so now I'm quite proud. The game level is made with a grid where each tile is set by an array, determining its properties and stuff. The player uses a simple controller similar to most games, and the ghosts just use manhattan distance to find the fastest route to you.

## Running The Game

To run it, you just need the latest version of Python (3.13 at the time, it may break in years to come) and the latest version of PyGame (2.6.1 right now). **Alternatively, I have compiled builds for Windows and Mac which can be found in the releases section of this repository.**

### Mac
If you are opening the game on Mac, you may get a security warning claiming "Apple cannot check it for malicious software". I promise this isnt a virus, to fix it just press OK, open System Settings, open Privacy and Security, scroll to the bottom, and press open anyway, inputting your password or touch ID, then confirming. It may take a few seconds to load but then the game should launch.

### Windows
Run the exe file (I will add info about security warnings as soon as I have access to a Windows computer.
